This repository contains a series of projects that all use the case of environmental impact assessment conducted for infrastructure projects under the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to understand questions about the infrastructure decision-making, environmental tradeoffs, administrative behavior, and climate adaptation.
